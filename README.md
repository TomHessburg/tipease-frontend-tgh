Hello! My name is Thomas Hessburg, and i'm a software developer from Central Florida. tipEase is a school project I built during my time at Lambda School, a 30+ week fully immersive dev bootcamp.

The first half of Lambda School is split into 3 sections:

1. User Interface
2. Frontend (building SPA's using React/Redux)
3. Backend (with a focus on Node/Express)

As a capstone to each of those sections, we join a team and complete a "Build Week". During build week, we are tasked with putting our new found skills into practice. tipEase was my assignment for the "Backend" section of class, however due to some unforseen complications, our frontend developer was unable to complete his portion of the assignment. Because of this, I took the opportunity to build out a frontend as well! And thus, everything you see here is built by me! Feel free to checkout all of the front end code here, as well as the deployed site:

and the backend code:

My backend API was also used to build an Android application by a team member of mine. You can check that out here if youd like as well!:
